				<li>Hello! My name is Grace. I come from China. Currently, I'm seeking a front-end job to which I can devote
					myself into. I studied Business Information Technology at Red River College in Manitoba for about 2.5 years.
					I have 8 months of Co-op experience as an application developer and data analyst by using C# in a capital
					management company.
				</li>
				<li>
					During the internship, my work was to meet the demands of the desktop application of my colleagues, like
					creating windows, which can
					display certain clients' financial data, fetching data from the Microsoft SQL server to generate certain
					financial analysis reports, and so on.
				</li>
				<li>My first job after graduation was been a customer service agent solving technical problems for clients.
					I’m fully committed to learning React after work and honing skills by doing projects so that I can land a
					dream job in the front-end industry.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the process of self taught, my ability of problem solving and debugging have been improved
					unprecedentedly.
				</li>
				<li>In my coding time, I have the habit of recording the tricky knowledge in my personal blog <ATag
					href="https://yueran-yu.github.io/" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">(My Blog)</ATag> when I
					encounter problems during constructing a project.
					It seems like an Errors collection that I can often review in case I forgot.
				</li>
				<li>In my spare time, I like running, since it keeps my fitness. I have been running for about 50 minutes every
					two days for almost half a year.
				</li>
